There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean


Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm (I'm)
